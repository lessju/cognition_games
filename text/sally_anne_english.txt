[explanation]

This 'game' is actually an experiment used to test 'Theory of Mind'. Theory of mind is the ability to understand one'self's or other people's beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions etc.
Theory of mind is important because this ability to understand what other people feel or believe allows us to predict what they will do.

The test was developed by Simon Baron-Cohen, Alan Leslie and Uta Firth in 1985.
These scientists carried out the test with children diagnosed with Autism, Down's Syndrome and typically developing children.
In order to pass the test the participant must answer the question by saying that Sally thinks the marble is still in her basket.
If the participant answers correctly s/he has Theory of mind because s/he can understand Sally's perspective.
If the participant answers incorrectly by saying that Sally will look in the box, s/he does not have Theory of Mind.
In this case the participant does not seem to understand that Sally's perspective can be different from his/her own.

80% of children diagnosed with autism answer the question incorrectly.
14% of children diagnosed with down syndrome also get the question incorrectly.
In the case of typically developing children, very small children (under the age of 6) usually are not able to guess correctly.
This is because Theory of Mind takes time to develop. 
Most typically developing children aged 6 or 7 guess correctly.
There is evidence to believe that the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans. 
This is why it has been proposed that lacking Theory of Mind may explain some of the social and communication difficulties experienced by individuals with developmental issues such as autism. (Tager-Flusberg (2007), Frith & Frith (2003))
